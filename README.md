# body-type-classification-ml
The project's goal is to predict somatype (class) based on physical parameters such as age, gender, height, weight, body fat percentage, wrist circumference, BMI, and WHR. Class/somatype â€“ a label for prediction (ecomorph, endomorph, mesomorph).

Various classifiers are being tested.

Automatic selection of the best model based on recall results. Prediction based on new data.

Once the best model is found, new data (e.g., characteristics of a new person) can be entered and their somatype classified.

The use of somatype classification has applications in sports, health diagnostics, and personal training.

The project uses classification as a machine learning method.
